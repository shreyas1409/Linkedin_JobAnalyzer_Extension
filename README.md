# Linkedin_JobAnalyzer_Extension



A Chrome extension I built for scanning LinkedIn job posting data to identify the most commonly requested skills by computer science employers. The aim is to empower computer science students like myself with insights into the skills highly sought after by employers.


Integrated the extension with a MongoDB database to store and manage the collected data
Uses a front end dashboard to see the frequency of the skills being requested by employers:

Leveraged a stack of JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB to create a versatile and efficient solution
